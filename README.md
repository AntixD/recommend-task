## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Project Structure

- **/components**: UI components organized by atomic design
  - **atoms**: Basic building blocks (Button, TextField)
  - **molecules**: Composed components (ChatMessage, EditorToolbar)
  - **organisms**: Complex components (ChatPanel, EditorContainer)
- **/hooks**: Custom React hooks for business logic
- **/store**: Zustand store for global state
- **/utils**: Utility functions (text chunking, mock responses)
- **/types**: TypeScript type definitions

### State Management

Global state is managed via Zustand with clear separation:

- **Chat State**: Messages, streaming status
- **Editor State**: Content, editable status, streaming content
- **UI State**: Focus management

### Data Flow

1. User sends message in ChatPanel
2. Message stored in Zustand store
3. Mock LLM response generated
4. Response streams to EditorContainer via chunks
5. Editor updates with live typing animation
6. User can edit the streamed content

### Streaming Implementation

- Text chunked into configurable word groups
- Variable delays between chunks for natural feel
- State management prevents race conditions
- Editor maintains cursor position during streaming

## üéØ Key Features Implementation

- Configurable chunk size (default: 3-5 words)
- Variable delay between chunks (80-120ms)
- Smooth append to editor without flickering
- Maintains formatting during stream

### Editor Features

### Chat Features
